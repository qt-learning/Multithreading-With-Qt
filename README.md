# Multithreading-With-Qt
 
This is the repo for the **Let's Get Thready: Multithreading with Qt** course on Qt Academy.

## Getting Started
- Navigate to the **00-Start** folder and open the `CMakeLists.txt` file with Qt Creator. You will be greeted with the `Raycaster` application used as a basis within the course.
- We will use **00-Start** as a basis for multiple exercises throughout the course, so it would be useful to keep a clean version on-hand!

## Instructions
To get started with this project, you will need to have an IDE such as Qt Creator installed on your computer. You can download Qt Creator from the [Qt.io website](qt.io).


Once you have Qt Creator installed, open the `00-Start` folder in Qt Creator. You can do this by opening Qt Creator selecting File > Open File or Project, and then navigating to the folder.
Running the Application
 
To run the application, simply build and run the project in Qt Creator. The application will launch and you will see a window with a red sphere. Try resizing the window and identifying what issues we have.
